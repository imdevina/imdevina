- 👋 Hi! @imdevina
- 👀 I worked in biotech/neuroscience research in the past 6 years.
- 🌱 I’m currently looking to pivot into data science by:
  1. Joining RISE by BCG Digital Academy
  2. Taking up online courses such as Andrew Ng's ML Coursera
  3. Build up my portfolio in Kaggle
  4. Try out Coding Competition (currently preparing for: codegoda.io)
- 💞️ In my free time, I enjoy playing with / video-documenting my 1-yo little girl, watching animes, or playing Dota2 with my husband. 
  Potential pet projects that I might work on:
  1. Image Recognition/Classification: to recognize my baby's face in photos/video & categorize her emotions.
  2. Anime Recommendation: so that I can have a watchlist that I would definitely enjoy.
  3. Dota2 Win Probability: based on the hero picks (I don't pay for Dota Plus XD).
- Feel free to chat & discuss on potential collab! :)
