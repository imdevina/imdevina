- ðŸ‘‹ Hi! @imdevina
- ðŸ‘€ I worked in biotech/neuroscience research in the past 6 years.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently looking to pivot into data science by:
  1. Joining RISE by BCG Digital Academy
  2. Taking up online courses such as Andrew Ng's ML Coursera
  3. Build up my portfolio in Kaggle
  4. Try out Coding Competition (attended codegoda.io)
